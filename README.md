[<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elenderg/Plain-English-Compiler/refs/heads/main/Compilation.png">](https://github.com/elenderg/Plain-English-Compiler/)

A compiler for the **Plain English Programming Language**, designed to make programming feel like writing ordinary English.  
The goal is to provide a natural, beginner-friendly syntax while still generating efficient native code.

## Features

- **Readable syntax** that uses common English words (`A`, `AN`, `THE`, etc.).
- Compiles Plain English source code into native machine code.
- Minimal learning curve for non-programmers.
- Extensible architecture for adding new keywords and rules.

## Example

A simple Plain English program might look like:

```
To run:  
  Write "Hello, world!" to the console.
  Shut down.  
```

And produces output:

```
Hello, world!
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Windows** (32-bit or 64-bit) â€” main target platform.

Philosophy

The Plain English Compiler is built on the belief that:
If you can explain it in English, you should be able to make a computer do it.
Instead of cryptic symbols and boilerplate, the syntax mirrors natural English sentences, making it more intuitive for beginners, writers, and non-technical audiences.
